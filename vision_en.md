# Vision & Exploration

As an IB educator, I envision a learning environment where students are empowered to take ownership of their learning.

## Long-Term Goals

- Encourage lifelong learning through inquiry.
- Integrate interdisciplinary approaches to real-world challenges.
- Foster intercultural understanding and respect.

## Innovation Plan

In the coming years, I plan to explore:

- Blending technology with language instruction (e.g., coding with Mandarin).
- Developing student agency through reflective journals.
- Connecting with global classrooms through online exchanges.
